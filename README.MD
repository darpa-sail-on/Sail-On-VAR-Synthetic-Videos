This repository is used for the purpose of storing and cataloging all of the synthetic video clips created for use in the SAIL-ON project's Video Activity Recognition Domain.

Each class/sub class will have its own folder, and within each will be a text file detailing the naming convention, items used, in game location recorded at, etc so that they can be recreated.
